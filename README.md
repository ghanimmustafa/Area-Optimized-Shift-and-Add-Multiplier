# Area-Optimized-Shift-and-Add-Multiplier
Module and testbench codes are given in Verilog for a low-cost synchronous, generic multiplier that uses only one adder with bit width as same as its inputs' bit width.
This design is optimal for cases when worst-case latency is accepted and best-case area is compulsory in small FPGA/ASIC to perform large multiplications such as 128-bit * 128-bit, 256-bit * 256-bit, .. etc.
